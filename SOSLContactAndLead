//The Apex class must be called ContactAndLeadSearch and be in the public scope
//The Apex class must have a public static method called searchContactsAndLeads
//The method must accept an incoming string as a parameter
//The method should then find any contact or lead that matches the string as part of either the 
//first or last name
//The method should finally use a return type of List<List< SObject>>
//NOTE: Because SOSL indexes data for searching, you must create a Contact record and Lead 
//record before checking this challenge. Both records must have the last name Smith. 
//The challenge uses these records for the SOSL search
