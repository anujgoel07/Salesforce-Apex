Create an Apex trigger that sets an accountâ€™s Shipping Postal Code to match the Billing Postal Code if the Match Billing Address option is selected. Fire the trigger before inserting an account or updating an account.

Pre-Work:
Add a checkbox field to the Account object:

Field Label: Match Billing Address
Field Name: Match_Billing_Address
Note: The resulting API Name should be Match_Billing_Address__c.
Create an Apex trigger:
Name: AccountAddressTrigger
Object: Account
Events: before insert and before update
Condition: Match Billing Address is true
Operation: set the Shipping Postal Code to match the Billing Postal Code





trigger AccountAddressTrigger on Account (before insert, before update) {
    for(Account a:Trigger.New){
        if(a.Match_Billing_Address__c==true){
            a.ShippingPostalCode=a.BillingPostalCode;
        }
    }
    
}
