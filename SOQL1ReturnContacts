//Create an Apex class that returns contacts based on incoming parameters.
//For this challenge, you will need to create a class that has a method accepting two strings. The method searches for contacts that have a last name matching the first string and a mailing postal code matching the second. It gets the ID and Name of those contacts and returns them.
//The Apex class must be called ContactSearch and be in the public scope
//The Apex class must have a public static method called searchForContacts
//The method must accept two incoming strings as parameters
//The method should then find any contact that has a last name matching the first string, and mailing postal code (API name: MailingPostalCode) matching the second string
//The method should finally return a list of Contact records of type List that includes the ID and Name fields


public class ContactSearch {
    public static List<Contact> searchForContacts(String lastName,String postalCode){
        List<Contact> contactsFound=[SELECT Id,FirstName,LastName,MailingPostalCode FROM Contact WHERE LastName=:lastName AND MailingPostalCode=:postalCode];
        return contactsFound;
    }   
}
